# Flow B — Start a plan cycle

## When to reach for a plan instead of just doing the work

Not every task needs this. A plan earns its cost when at least one is true:
the work will span more than one session, more than one person will touch
the diff before it merges, or a mistake here is expensive to unwind. A
one-file fix does not need a `PLAN-N.md` — doing it directly, with a good
commit message, is more disciplined than ceremony for its own sake.

## Step 1 — Interrogate the ambiguity BEFORE writing anything

A plan written on top of unresolved ambiguity looks rigorous and is not.
Before filling the template, scan what the user told you for gaps, and ask
about **at most the three highest-impact ones**. Do not interrogate for
sport: most gaps are better resolved during the work, and asking about
them costs the user's patience without buying safety.

A gap is high-impact if getting it wrong would change the shape of the
phases, not just their content. In practice it is almost always one of:

- **A scope boundary.** Is X part of this cycle or a later one? (Wrong
  guess = a phase built for the wrong target.)
- **A structural decision with more than one defensible answer.** One
  change per phase or one for the whole plan? New module or extend the
  existing one? (Wrong guess = rework, not just edits.)
- **A pre-existing constraint you cannot see.** Is there an existing
  convention, a downstream consumer, a deadline that forces sequencing?

Ask each with **your own recommendation and its reasoning attached**, not
as an open question — the user should be able to answer "sí" and move on:

> "Recomiendo un change por fase, porque conserva el gate humano entre
> fases. La alternativa (uno solo para todo el plan) es más liviana pero
> pierde ese control intermedio. ¿Vamos con lo primero?"

If a gap is high-impact and you cannot recommend an answer because the
information genuinely lives only with the user, say exactly that, and
**mark it inside the plan as a `## DECISIÓN ABIERTA` block that the
executor must not pass** — a plan may ship with an open decision as long
as it is flagged as a STOP, never as a silent assumption.

## Step 2 — Fill the template

From `assets/PLAN.md.template`:

- **Objective**, one sentence. If you can't compress it to one sentence,
  the scope isn't decided yet — go back to the user before writing phases.
- **Diagnosis / evidence**, if the plan is fixing something concrete —
  what's wrong, how you know (a failing command, a bug report, a
  reproduction), not a guess.
- **Phases (F1, F2, ...)**, each with: what changes, the concrete spec,
  what tests prove it (write the adversarial test *before* the fix and
  confirm it fails against current code — RED before GREEN, literally
  shown, not assumed), and acceptance criteria **as checkboxes**
  (`- [ ] ...`), because they get ticked as they are demonstrated (Flow C).
- **Out of scope**, explicit. Anything tempting-but-tangential goes here,
  not into a phase "while we're at it." This section prevents more scope
  creep than any other single habit in this skill.

## Step 3 — Self-audit the plan before handing it over

Read-only pass over what you just wrote. Do not hand a plan to the user
without running it:

1. **Coverage.** Does every acceptance criterion have a test or a concrete
   demonstration behind it? A criterion nothing proves is decoration.
2. **Checkability.** Any criterion that reads like a vibe ("should work
   well", "is cleaner") is a defect — rewrite it as something a command
   can answer, or drop it.
3. **Scope leak.** Is anything from "Out of scope" quietly present in a
   phase body? If yes, either it is in scope (move it) or it is not
   (remove it) — never both.
4. **Phase size.** Can each phase be reviewed as a single diff? If a phase
   only makes sense once a later one lands, they are one phase, not two —
   or the split is in the wrong place.
5. **Dependency order.** Does any phase need something a later phase
   builds?

Report the findings to the user in two or three lines *with* the plan
("revisé el plan: F2 tenía un criterio no verificable, lo reescribí"), not
as a separate ceremony. If a finding needs a decision you can't make,
that's a `## DECISIÓN ABIERTA` block, same as Step 1.

## Step 4 — Hand over, do not execute

Write `PLAN-N.md` to the repo root. **Do not start executing a phase in
the same turn the plan is created** — the human reviews the plan itself
first. Never overwrite an existing `PLAN-N.md`: each cycle gets its own
file; old ones are history, not clutter, and stay in the repo.

Give the user the session-start prompt to reuse for each phase:

> "Ejecutá la Fase F{N} según PLAN-{N}.md. Si el plan es ambiguo o creés
> que está mal: PARÁ y preguntá. Al terminar: reportá archivos cambiados,
> tests agregados, cualquier desviación del plan, y preguntas abiertas —
> después detenete, yo audito el diff."

(Translate to the chat language in use, keep the content identical.)

## The non-negotiable rules (put these in the plan or the AGENTS.md contract,
## not just in this reference — the executor needs to see them, not you)

- One phase = one session = one reviewable diff. Never chain phases in a
  single turn without the human looking at what happened in between.
- The plan is the spec. If code and plan disagree, that's a bug in one of
  them — stop and say which, don't silently pick one.
- No new dependencies without explicit approval, ever, mid-phase.
- Ambiguity is a STOP condition, not a coin flip. An agent that guesses
  well on 9 out of 10 ambiguous calls will eventually guess wrong on
  something expensive — the rule exists for the tenth time, not the first
  nine.
- A plan cycle produces a *report* at the end of each phase (files changed,
  tests added with what each one guards against, deviations with
  justification, open questions) — never just a diff with no narration.
  The narration is what makes human audit fast instead of a full re-read.

## What this does not give you

No file here is transactional. If the session dies mid-phase, there is no
`manifest.json` to resume from — the human re-reads `PLAN-N.md`, checks
`git log` and `git status`, and tells the next session which phase is
actually in progress. Ticked checkboxes help, but they are written by an
agent that could have ticked them wrong; they are a convenience, not a
guarantee. That is exactly the gap `context-guard` closes if a project
ever needs code-enforced state instead — see "Upgrade path" in SKILL.md.
